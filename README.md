PySwizzle
=========

This is a Twitter bot that replies to any @-mention with a randomly chosen
Taylor Swift lyric.  It is deployed on Twitter as
[@pyswizzle](https://twitter.com/pyswizzle).

You can find the library I wrote and used to download all of Taylor Swift's
lyrics [here](https://github.com/brenns10/tswift) - or just `pip install
tswift`.

This project was originally a tutorial I presented to Freshman interested in
Computer Science during orientation 2015.  That version of the code and tutorial
is still available [here](https://github.com/brenns10/pypie15int), but is no
longer deployed.
